## Notes

- Windows only -- requires Exchange Web Services (EWS).
- ExchangeScope: when placed inside an ExchangeScope, the activity inherits the authenticated connection. When used standalone, connection properties from the base ExchangeActivity are used.
- The `MailMessage` must be a [MailMessage](types/MailMessage.md) previously retrieved via `GetExchangeMailMessages`, since it relies on the Exchange item ID stored in the message headers.
- `DeleteMode` values: `MoveToDeletedItems` (default, reversible), `SoftDelete` (recoverable via server admin), `HardDelete` (permanent deletion).
- Related activities: GetExchangeMailMessages, MoveMessageToFolder, ExchangeScope.
