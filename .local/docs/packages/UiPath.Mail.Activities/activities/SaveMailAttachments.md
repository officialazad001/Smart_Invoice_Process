# Save Email Attachments

`UiPath.Mail.Activities.SaveMailAttachments`

**Package:** `UiPath.Mail.Activities`
**Category:** Mail

## Properties

## XAML Example

```xml
<mail:SaveMailAttachments
    Message="[mailMessage]"
    FolderPath="C:\Emails\Attachments"
    Filter=""
    OverwriteExisting="[True]"
    ExcludeInlineAttachments="[False]"
    Attachments="[savedPaths]" />
```

## Notes

- The `Message` property is required. The activity raises a validation error if it is not provided.
- When `ExcludeInlineAttachments` is false (the default), inline attachments embedded in the email body via alternate views and linked resources are also saved.
- The `Filter` property accepts a .NET regex pattern. The pattern is matched against the full file path of each attachment (folder path + file name).
- When `OverwriteExisting` is false (the default), duplicate file names will cause an error.
- The `ResourceAttachments` output is only populated if its expression is bound in the workflow.
