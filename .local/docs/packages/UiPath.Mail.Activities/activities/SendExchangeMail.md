## XAML Example

```xml
<exc:SendExchangeMail
    To="recipient@example.com"
    Subject="Test Subject"
    Body="Hello from Exchange!"
    IsBodyHtml="False"
    SaveCopy="[True]" />
```

## Notes

- Windows only -- requires Exchange Web Services (EWS).
- ExchangeScope: when placed inside an ExchangeScope, the activity inherits the authenticated connection. When used standalone, connection properties from the base ExchangeActivity are used.
- Setting `IsDraft` to true saves the message to the Drafts folder instead of sending it. Consider using `CreateDraft` for a dedicated draft creation workflow.
- The `MailMessage` property enables forwarding an existing message. Provide a [MailMessage](types/MailMessage.md) previously retrieved from Exchange.
- Multiple recipients can be specified by separating email addresses with semicolons.
- Related activities: CreateDraft, GetExchangeMailMessages, ExchangeScope.
