## Notes

- Windows only -- requires Exchange Web Services (EWS).
- ExchangeScope: when placed inside an ExchangeScope, the activity inherits the authenticated connection. When used standalone, connection properties from the base ExchangeActivity are used.
- The `MailMessage` property enables creating a draft that forwards an existing [MailMessage](types/MailMessage.md).
- Multiple recipients can be specified by separating email addresses with semicolons.
