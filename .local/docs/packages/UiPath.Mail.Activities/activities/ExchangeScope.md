## Scope Body

ExchangeScope is a `NativeActivity` with a `Body` (ActivityAction\<ExchangeService\>). Place child Exchange activities (CreateDraft, DeleteMail, GetExchangeMailMessages, MoveMessageToFolder, SaveExchangeAttachements, SendExchangeMail) inside the Body. Child activities automatically inherit the authenticated ExchangeService connection and do not need their own connection properties.

## XAML Example

```xml
<exc:ExchangeScope
    Server="https://outlook.office365.com/EWS/Exchange.asmx"
    User="user@contoso.com"
    Password="password"
    ExchangeVersion="Exchange2013">
  <exc:ExchangeScope.Body>
    <ActivityAction x:TypeArguments="ews:ExchangeService">
      <ActivityAction.Argument>
        <DelegateInArgument x:TypeArguments="ews:ExchangeService" Name="ExchangeConnection" />
      </ActivityAction.Argument>
      <Sequence DisplayName="Do">
        <exc:GetExchangeMailMessages
            CustomFolder="Inbox"
            Top="[10]"
            Messages="[messages]" />
      </Sequence>
    </ActivityAction>
  </exc:ExchangeScope.Body>
</exc:ExchangeScope>
```

## Notes

- Windows only -- requires Exchange Web Services (EWS).
- This is a scope activity: all Exchange child activities placed inside it inherit the authenticated connection and do not need their own connection configuration.
- Three connection overload groups exist (only one should be used at a time):
  - **Server**: Provide the EWS endpoint URL directly.
  - **AutoDiscover**: Provide an email address and Exchange will auto-discover the server endpoint.
  - **ExistingConnection**: Reuse an ExchangeService instance from a previous ExchangeScope.
- When using Office 365 OAuth 2.0 (`AuthenticationMode = Interactive`), `ApplicationId` is required. For non-interactive modes, both `ApplicationId` and `DirectoryId` must be provided together.
- `ExistingExchangeService` cannot be combined with credential properties (Domain, User, Password, SecurePassword).
- The output `ExchangeService` property can be captured and passed to another ExchangeScope via `ExistingExchangeService` to share an authenticated session.
- Related activities: CreateDraft, DeleteMail, GetExchangeMailMessages, MoveMessageToFolder, SaveExchangeAttachements, SendExchangeMail.
