## Notes

- This is a trigger activity that starts a workflow when a new email arrives in the specified IMAP folder.
- The `MailFolder` property is validated at design time; a validation error is raised if it is empty.
- The `Filter` and `FilterExpression` properties exist but are not browsable (hidden from the designer).
- Connection details (server, port, credentials) are configured through the connection service, not directly on the activity.
- The trigger uses the `receivedEmail` output variable name internally.
- Related activities: `GetIMAPMailMessages`, `MoveIMAPMailMessageToFolder`, `DeleteImapMailMessage`.
