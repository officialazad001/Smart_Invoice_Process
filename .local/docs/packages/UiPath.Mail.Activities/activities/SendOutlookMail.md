## Notes

- Windows only -- requires Outlook COM interop
- Outlook must be installed and configured on the machine
- When [`MailMessage`](types/MailMessage.md) is provided, the email is forwarded rather than sent as a new message
- The `IsDraft` property saves the message to the Drafts folder without sending
- `SentOnBehalfOfName` requires delegate/send-on-behalf permissions configured in the mail system
