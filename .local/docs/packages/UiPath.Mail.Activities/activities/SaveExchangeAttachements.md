## Notes

- Windows only -- requires Exchange Web Services (EWS).
- ExchangeScope: when placed inside an ExchangeScope, the activity inherits the authenticated connection. When used standalone, connection properties from the base ExchangeActivity are used.
- The class name retains the original spelling "Attachements" (with an extra 'e') for backward compatibility.
- The `MailMessage` must be a [MailMessage](types/MailMessage.md) previously retrieved via `GetExchangeMailMessages` with attachment metadata intact.
- The `ResourceAttachments` output provides ILocalResource references, which is useful for passing attachments to other resource-aware activities.
- Related activities: GetExchangeMailMessages, ExchangeScope.
